## Hello there! 👋

I'm Laureano, and I am a software developer based in Argentina.

I'm currently working as a full stack web developer for the city of Berisso, where I develop internal use applications.
We use the Laravel framework for PHP in the backend, and Laravel's templating engine Blade for the frontend.
I also have experience as a Junior Linux SysAdmin and as a IT Support technician.

In my free time I enjoy coding, playing around with hardware and Linux.
